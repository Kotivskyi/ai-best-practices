description: 'write a plan for how we should create a new feature'
---
- create a plan for how we shoud create a new feature
- make sure to search the codebase
- do not implement the feature, just create a plan
- When plan is created, ask me questions (max 3) if anything is unclear

# Important: this project does not have unit test anr integration tests, so please do not include them in the plan. Develoer will test the feature manually.


1. Create task lists in a markdown file (in the project root):
   - Use `TASKS.md` or a descriptive name relevant to the feature (e.g., `TASK_ASSISTANT_CHAT.md`)
   - Include a clear title and description of the feature being implemented

2. Structure the file with these sections:
   ```markdown
   # Feature Name Implementation
   
   Brief description of the feature and its purpose.
   
   - [x] Task 1 that has been completed
   - [x] Task 2 that has been completed
   - [ ] Task 3 currently being worked on
   - [ ] Task 4 to be completed soon
   - [ ] Task 5 planned for future implementation
   - [ ] Task 6 planned for future implementation
   
   ## Implementation Plan
   
   Detailed description of how the feature will be implemented.
   
   ### Relevant Files
   
   - path/to/file1.ts - Description of purpose
   - path/to/file2.ts - Description of purpose
   ```
